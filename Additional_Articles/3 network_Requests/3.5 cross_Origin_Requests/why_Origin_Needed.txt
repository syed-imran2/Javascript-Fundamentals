1. Why Origin is needed, if Referer has even more information?
2. Is it possible that there’s no Referer or Origin, or is it incorrect?

answer:
1. We need Origin, because sometimes Referer is absent. For instance,
   when we fetch HTTP-page from HTTPS (access less secure from more secure),
   then there’s no Referer.
2. Yes, it's possible that there’s no Referer or no Origin header in an HTTP request
   and this is not necessarily incorrect.
