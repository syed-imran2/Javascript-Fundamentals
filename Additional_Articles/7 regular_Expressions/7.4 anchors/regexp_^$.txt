Which string matches the pattern ^$?

answer:

An empty string is the only match: it starts and immediately finishes.

The task once again demonstrates that anchors are not characters, but tests.

The string is empty "". The engine first matches the ^ (input start), 
yes it’s there,and then immediately the end $, it’s here too. 
So there’s a match.
